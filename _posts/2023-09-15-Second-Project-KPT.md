### 1. Project Overview

1) What We Did

   - Project Name: Wish List for Desired Countries
   - Mandatory Tasks: Login, Registration, Logout, Feed Page (viewable without login), Post Creation Page (for logged-in users only), Detailed Post Page (post details, editable/deletable by the post creator)
   - Additional Tasks: Comment functionality, email verification during registration, password reset, password requirements, date widget addition, automatic display of desired countries on the map

2) Thoughts

   - Jisoo - Django was challenging, but I learned a lot by following along and dissecting the functionalities step by step. Initially, I found dealing with errors and problem-solving daunting, but I felt a sense of achievement when I resolved errors and saw the functionalities working properly. I was amazed when my team members implemented functionalities that I couldn't. Sharing the process of the same project was a valuable learning experience. I wish I could have contributed more to additional features, and I feel sorry that I couldn't share what I did or what I know with my team members.
   - Gyuhwan - It was quite challenging to implement the server with the limited knowledge I gained from the class. I struggled a lot, often asking very detailed questions to the tutor, which might have been a bit bothersome. However, everyone in the team faithfully fulfilled their respective roles, and I learned a lot, making it a fulfilling project.
   - Jaeyoon - I felt that I hadn't fully implemented the basics of Django yet, as I ended up using the Allauth package. I focused too much on additional functionalities, and I regret that. However, by merging and resolving errors on GitHub for our individual tasks, I gained more confidence for future team projects. I also regret not sharing more with my team members.
   - Myeonggyeong - I participated in the project with a lack of basic knowledge, which made me feel lost from the beginning. I tried my best to help my team members, but it was not as easy as I thought. Nevertheless, I was fortunate to have great team members in my first group project, and I learned a lot about coding.
   - Hyunwoo - The experience of working on a team project with members who had different skill levels was very positive and a great learning experience. However, due to my limited knowledge of Django, there were many shortcomings in the backend-frontend integration, which was disappointing.

### 2. Keep

- Sharing solutions when we solved issues together
- Effective communication
- Adhering to scheduled meeting times
- Attending and reviewing lectures
- Setting specific meeting times for discussing progress, issues, etc.
- Being proactive
- Individual efforts

### 3. Problem

1) Issues

   - Errors when pulling from GitHub
   - Failure to implement the DB server
   - Inexperience with Git usage
   - Lack of detailed elements in the initial System Architecture (SA)
   - HTML modifications in Allauth

2) Causes

   - Python versions were not synchronized before starting the project.
   - Failure to set a clear goal for implementing the DB server resulted in not completing it in time.
   - Lack of basic knowledge at the beginning.
   - Lack of familiarity with Allauth due to attempting to use it without sufficient experience in customizing it.

### 4. Try

1. Always synchronize Python versions for the project.
2. Share progress and errors with accurate communication.
3. Concrete idea development and planning during the project's planning phase.
