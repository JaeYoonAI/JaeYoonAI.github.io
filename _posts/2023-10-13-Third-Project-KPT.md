# Project Overview
**Project Name:** Alpha-Critic
Alpha-Critic is a web service that allows users to freely leave ratings, reviews, and evaluations for the latest content in the world of movie music games.

**Technologies Used:** DRF (Django Rest Framework), HTML, CSS, JS, and AWS for deployment.

# Keep
1. **Smooth Deployment:** We aim to maintain a deployment process that flows seamlessly.
2. **Impressive Front-end:** We want to enhance the aesthetics and user experience of our front-end.
3. **Continual Learning:** We appreciate the learning opportunities during the project, especially during the course reviews.

# Problem
1. **Late Start on Front-end:** We began working on the front-end development relatively late in the project timeline.
2. **Difficulty in Backend-Frontend Integration:** Connecting the back-end with the front-end posed challenges.
3. **Data Scraping and Storage:** We faced issues related to scraping data and saving it to local or MongoDB databases.

# Try
1. We partially resolved the backend-frontend integration by using pure Django.
2. In the absence of automated data scraping, we manually entered data through the admin interface.
3. To address backend-frontend connection issues, we sought assistance from our tutors.

# Thoughts
1. **By Jae-yoon Lee:** I've learned that effective planning is crucial. I should invest more time and effort at the beginning to avoid regrets later on.
2. **By Woo-jin Kim:** Thanks to the dedication of my team members, I had the opportunity to learn and contribute. I regret not starting the structural analysis earlier, and I plan to devote more time to studying on weekends.
3. **By Jung-won Kwak:** I need to work on improving my front-end development skills. Taking over the role came very close to the project deadline, which led to deployment delays. I recognize the need to prepare in advance by acquiring some proficiency in front-end development in case similar situations arise in the future. Despite many shortcomings, I'm grateful for the successful completion of the project.
