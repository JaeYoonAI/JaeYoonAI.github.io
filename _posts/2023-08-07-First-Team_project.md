Today was my first day of developer bootcamp. There are still plenty of lectures to take but I thought preparing a group web-site which introduces our team members is a priority. Fortunately, I was elected as a team leader and also a presenter.

We decided to choose an Instagram theme for exemplification.From now, Instagram 'posting' will be used to introduce our team while 'stories' will be focusing on members' personal information. 

I attached an image below.

We are going to use python for coding and figma for front-end design and bootstrap.

I will post another page after building a code structure.
