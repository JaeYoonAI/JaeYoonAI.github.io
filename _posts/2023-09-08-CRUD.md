Tomorrow is the day to submit assignments using Django, but I only started taking related lectures today.   
Solving the algorithm problem was difficult, but in Django, it felt like the difficulty level suddenly increased.   
I was even more confused, perhaps because I thought I had to listen to the lecture quickly.   
So far, I've only learned about signing up and logging in, but I need to put in more effort tonight.


Below, I wrote down my thoughts and chatGPT on things to keep in mind when learning Django for the first time.


1. **Python Knowledge:** Ensure you have a good understanding of Python programming, including data structures, object-oriented programming, and basic syntax. Django is built using Python, so a strong foundation in Python is essential.

2. **MVC Architecture:** Understand the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern that Django follows. In Django, it's referred to as Model-View-Template (MVT), where Models represent your data, Views handle the logic and presentation, and Templates define the HTML structure.

3. **Django Documentation:** Django has excellent official documentation. Familiarize yourself with it and use it as your primary reference. The documentation covers everything from installation to advanced features.

4. **Installation and Setup:** Follow the official installation guide for Django. Use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies and isolate your Django projects from each other.

5. **Project Structure:** Learn the basic structure of a Django project, which includes settings, apps, URLs, and templates. Understanding how these components interact is crucial.

6. **Database Configuration:** Django supports various databases. Learn how to configure your chosen database and define models to represent your data. Django's Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) simplifies database interactions.

7. **Views and URL Patterns:** Comprehend how views and URL patterns work together. Views handle HTTP requests and responses, and URL patterns define how URLs map to views.

8. **Templates and HTML/CSS:** Learn how to create templates using Django's template language. It's important to have a good grasp of HTML and CSS for designing your website.

9. **Forms:** Understand how to work with Django forms for user input handling and validation. Django provides powerful form-handling capabilities.

10. **Authentication and Authorization:** Learn how to implement user authentication and authorization using Django's built-in tools. Security is critical when building web applications.

11. **Static and Media Files:** Know how to serve static files like CSS, JavaScript, and images. Additionally, understand how to handle user-uploaded media files.

12. **Middleware:** Familiarize yourself with middleware and how it can be used to process requests and responses globally in your application.

13. **Django Admin:** Django provides an admin interface for managing your application's data. Learn how to customize and secure the admin site.

14. **Version Control:** Use version control systems like Git to track changes in your codebase. This makes collaboration and code management easier.

15. **Testing:** Learn how to write unit tests and integration tests for your Django application. Testing is crucial for maintaining code quality.

16. **Deployment:** Understand the process of deploying a Django application to a production server. Consider using deployment tools like Docker, AWS, or Heroku.

17. **Security:** Pay attention to security best practices, such as protecting against common web vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

18. **Community and Resources:** Join the Django community by participating in forums, mailing lists, and attending meetups or conferences. There are many online resources and tutorials available.

19. **Projects and Practice:** The best way to learn is by doing. Start with small Django projects and gradually work on more complex applications.

20. **Stay Updated:** Django and web development technologies evolve. Stay updated with the latest Django releases and best practices.

It will be a long journey, but I will have to learn while thinking about the above.
