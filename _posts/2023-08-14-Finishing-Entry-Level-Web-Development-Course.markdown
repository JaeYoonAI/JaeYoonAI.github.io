Finally, I have finished the web developer course.

I use DBmongo, AWS to upload my web page.

<a href="http://myweb.eba-c2erxcip.ap-northeast-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/">Please visit my work.</a>

As you can see at my web page, I use several technics.

1. Use API to show real-time temperature.
2. Use DBmongo to 'get' and 'post'.
3. Use Flask for fram work.
4. Use AWS for publishing web site.

I'm new to learning, but as I was setting up AWS, I realized that I had to pay a lot of attention to security.
